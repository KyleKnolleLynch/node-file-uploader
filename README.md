# Node.js File Uploader

This app uploads files to a node.js rest API via HTML form and vanilla javascript. Using custom middleware with the express-fileupload package, we are now able to upload multiple files at once, a feature not offered with the included middleware in the express-fileupload package. This example is set up for image files but any files can be uploaded by changing the file extension names.
